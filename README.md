# About mouse (MPL)

<img width="1438" alt="mpl" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/61304748-f28c2480-a7e9-11e9-98eb-31e0ef33f09e.png">

    INFO: Mouse Payload Loader (MPL) is a post exploitation surveillance tool written 
    in Python, C and Objective-C. It gives you a command line session with extra functionality 
    between you and a target machine with simple MPL payload. MPL gives you the power and convenience 
    of uploading/downloading files, tab completion, taking pictures, location tracking, shell command 
    execution, persistence, escalating privileges, password retrieval, and much more.
  
***
    
# Getting started

## macOS/Linux installation

> cd mouse

> chmod +x install.sh

> ./install.sh

## iOS (jailbroken) installation

> cd mouse

> chmod +x install.sh

> ./install.sh

# Building payloads (macOS/iOS)

<img width="1440" alt="payloads" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/61581483-fe942100-ab1e-11e9-96e9-76a4a3da6b4a.png">

    INFO: MPL payloads are executed on the target machine. The payload first sends over 
    instructions for getting and sending back device details to our server and then chooses 
    the appropriate executable to establish a secure remote control session.

## Bourne-Again Shell payload

    INFO: Selecting bash from the payload menu will give us a 1 liner that 
    establishes a remote MPL session upon execution on the target machine.
    
## Entynet PI payload (USB injection)

    INFO: Entynet PI is a development board that can be programmed 
    with the Arduino IDE. It emulates USB keyboard strokes extremely 
    fast and can inject the MPL payload just in a few seconds.
    
    Developer: Entynetproject (Ivan Nikolsky)

## Rubber Duck payload (USB injection)

    INFO: USB Rubber Duck is a development USB board that can inject 
    uploaded to duck SD card inject.bin payload in a few seconds!
    
    Developer: Hak5 (Darren Kitchen)
    
## MacOS Application payload

    INFO: This is a standart Mouse (MPL) Payload 
    that converted to the MacOS Application.

# Mouse CLI

<img width="1440" alt="cli" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/62371639-a0f7cf80-b535-11e9-97e1-5298c99c117a.png">

    INFO: After a session is established, we can execute commands on that device 
    through the Mouse (MPL) CLI. We can show all available commands by typing "help".
    
## Taking pictures

    INFO: Both iOS and macOS payloads have picture taking capability. 
    The picture command lets you take a picture from the iSight on 
    macOS as well as the front or back camera on iOS.
    
## Tab completion

    INFO: Similar to most command line interfaces, MPL supports 
    tab completion. When you start typing the path to a directory or 
    filename, we can complete the rest of the path using the tab key.

# MultiHandler CLI

<img width="1440" alt="mh" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43011806/62371637-a0f7cf80-b535-11e9-95cb-d2801225aa78.png">

    INFO: The Multihandler option lets us handler multiple 
    sessions. We can choose to interact with different devices 
    while listening for new connections in the background.
    
***

# Mouse Substrate (MPL Substrate)

    INFO: Mouse Substrate (MPL Substrate) is a package that will 
    be installed on the victim's iOS device after receiving remote 
    control. Mouse Substrate allows you to run substrate commands 
    and services on the victimâ€™s remote iOS device.

    INFO: MPL commands are commands that allow you to control a remote device via 
    Mouse CLI or via MultiHandler CLI. Each operating system of the remote device has 
    its own set of MPL commands. You can explore supported operating systems bellow.
