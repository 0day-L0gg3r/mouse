# About mouse

    INFO: Mouse Payload Loader (MPL) is a post exploitation surveillance tool written in 
    Python, C and Objective-C. It gives you a command line session with extra functionality 
    between you and a target machine with simple MPL payload. MPL gives you the power and 
    convenience of uploading/downloading files, tab completion, taking pictures, location tracking, 
    shell command execution, persistence, escalating privileges, password retrieval, and much more.
  
***
    
# Getting started

## macOS/Linux installation

> cd mouse

> chmod +x install.sh

> ./install.sh

## iOS (jailbroken) installation

> cd mouse

> chmod +x install.sh

> ./install.sh

***

# Building payloads

    INFO: MPL payloads are executed on the target machine. The payload first sends over 
    instructions for getting and sending back device details to our server and then chooses 
    the appropriate executable to establish a secure remote control session.

## Bourne-Again Shell payload

    INFO: Selecting bash from the payload menu will give us a 1 liner that 
    establishes a remote MPL session upon execution on the target machine.
    
## Entynet PI payload (USB injection)

    INFO: Entynet PI is a development board that can be programmed 
    with the Arduino IDE. It emulates usb keyboard strokes extremely 
    fast and can inject the MPL payload just in a few seconds.
    
    Developer: Entynetproject (Ivan Nikolsky)

## Rubber Duck payload (USB injection)

    INFO: USB Rubber Duck is a development USB board that can inject 
    uploaded to duck SD card inject.bin payload in a few seconds!
    
    Developer: Hak5 (Darren Kitchen)

# Interacting with a session

    INFO: After a session is established, we can execute commands 
    on that device through the MPL command line interface. 
    We can show all the available commands by typing "help".
    
## Taking pictures

    INFO: Both iOS and macOS payloads have picture taking capability. 
    The picture command lets you take a picture from the iSight on 
    macOS as well as the front or back camera on iOS.
    
## Tab completion

    INFO: Similar to most command line interfaces, MPL supports 
    tab completion. When you start typing the path to a directory or 
    filename, we can complete the rest of the path using the tab key.

***

# Multihandler CLI

    INFO: The Multihandler option lets us handler multiple 
    sessions. We can choose to interact with different devices 
    while listening for new connections in the background.

# Mouse Substrate (MPL Substrate)

    INFO: This is a package that will be installed on the victim's iOS 
    device after receiving remote control. Mouse Substrate allows you to 
    run substrate commands and services on the victimâ€™s remote iOS device.
